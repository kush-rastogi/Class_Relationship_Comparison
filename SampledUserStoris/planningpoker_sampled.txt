As a moderator, I want to accept the average of all estimates, so that we can move on to the next item when we agree.

As a moderator, I want to export a transcript of a game as a CSV file, so that I can further process the items and estimates.
As a participant, I want to immediately see that an estimate has been given by a specific estimator, so that I know who has already given an estimate and who we re still waiting for.
As a moderator, I want to copy/paste items from a spreadsheet, so that I can get started more quickly.
As a moderator, I want to invite estimators by giving them a URL where they can access the game, so that we can start the game.
